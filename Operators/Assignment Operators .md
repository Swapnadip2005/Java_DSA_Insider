# Assignment Operators

In Java, `Assignment Operators` are used to assign values to variables. They combine the assignment operation with other operations, allowing for concise code.

# Types Of Assignment Operators

- ### Assignment =
  Assigns the value on the `right` to the variable on the `left`.
  ```java
  int x = 5;
  ```
- ### Addition Assignment +=
  ```java
  int x = 5;
  x += 4; // as same as x = x + 4; (x = 9)
  ```
- ### Subtraction Assignment -=
  ```java
  int x = 10;
  x -= 5; // as same as x = x - 5; (x = 5)
  ```
- ### Multiplication Assignment *=
  ```java
  int x = 3;
  x *= 4; // as same as x = x * 4; (x = 12)
  ```
- ### Division Assignment /=
  ```java
  int x = 32;
  x /= 4; // as same as x = x / 4; (x = 8)
  ```
- ### Modulus Assignment %=
  ```java
  int x = 10;
  x %= 3; // as same as x = x % 3; (x = 1)
  ```
