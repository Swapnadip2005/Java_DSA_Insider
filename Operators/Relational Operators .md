# Relational Operators

In Java, `Relational Operators` are used to compare two values and determine the relationship between them. These operators return a `Boolean result`, either `true` or `false`, based on the comparison.

# Types of Relational Operators

- Equality ==
- Inequality !=
- Greater than >
- Less than <
- Greater than or Equal to >=
- Less than or Equal to <=

> [!NOTE]
> `Relational Operators` are often used in control flow statements, such as `if statements` and `loops`, to make decisions based on the relationships between variables.
