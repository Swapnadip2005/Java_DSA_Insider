# while loop
The `while loop` is used `when the number of iterations is not known in advance`, and the loop `continues as long as a specified condition is true`.

# Syntax
```java
while (condition) {
    // Code to be repeated
}
```
# Example
```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    System.out.println("Iteration " + i);
    i++;
}
```
