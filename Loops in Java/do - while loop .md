# do - while loop
The `do-while loop is similar to the while loop`, but it guarantees that the code inside the `loop is executed at least once because the condition is checked after the loop body`.
# Syntax
```java
do {
    // Code to be repeated
} while (condition);
```
# Example
```java
int i = 0;
do {
    System.out.println("Iteration " + i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
```
