# What will be the type of result in the given code ?

```java
byte b = 4;
char c = 'a';
short s = 512;
int i = 1000;
float f = 3.14f;
double d = 99.9954;
result = (f*b)+(i%c)-(d*s);
```
The `result` variable will be of `double` type due to `Type Conversion` and is the largest datatype available in the expression.
