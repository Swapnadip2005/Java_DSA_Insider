> **Native Code** is different for different operating systems and can run on any operating systems.  
> This is why Java is also called `Portable Language`

# Portable Language
A portable programming language is like a tool that works on different kinds of computers and systems without needing big changes. This is good because it lets programmers write code just one time and use it on many types of computers. They don't have to do a lot of extra work for each computer or system.

> [!TIP]
> `C++` is not a Portable Language.
