# Variables 

- In Java, a variable is a container that holds a data value. 
- Variables are used to store and manipulate data in a program. 
- Variables must be declared with a specific data type before they can be used.

# How to declare a Variable ?

```java
int num = 50;
```

> [!NOTE]  
> - num = `Variable`
> - int = `Data Type`

# What happens in Memory ?

```java
int a = 50;
int b = 100;
String name = "Tony";
```
